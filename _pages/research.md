I study the impact of public opinion on counterinsurgency tactics by asking how governments mitigate the costs of their counterinsurgency efforts. In a secondary agenda, I study the intersection between domestic politics and foreign policy, emphasizing the role of domestic politics in foreign policy making.

- Constituents in Peril: How Political Channels and Public Services Influence Insurgent Tactics.
  -   <details>

        <summary>Abstract:</summary>
        Insurgents may risk their constituents' lives and protect themselves by conducting more indirect attacks against incumbent forces. Existing scholarship emphasizes the costs of civilian victimization on the responsible warring party. Extending this line of research, I ask under what conditions insurgent groups accept these costs, risking their own constituents' lives. I posit that insurgents employ riskier tactics that can put constituents' lives in danger when constituents are more likely to support the insurgency because of a lack of political channels and insufficient government public services. I test the implications of this theory using micro-level event data on construction and violence in Iraq from 2004 to 2009, survey data from Mosul after the city's liberation from the Islamic State, and cross-national data from over ninety conflicts from 1989 to 2013. I show that the increase in viable political channels, such as government centers or peace negotiations, exerts a substantial mitigating effect on the likelihood of insurgents engaging in indirect attacks within regions densely populated by their constituents. I also show that insurgents victimize civilians less when they do not provide public services better than the government. These outcomes highlight the broader significance of maintaining open political channels of communication with insurgent constituents and providing public services as the government, as they shape not only the relationship between the government and its citizens but also the dynamics between insurgent groups and their constituents.
