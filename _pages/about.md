Welcome!

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Emory University. 

I study the impact of public opinion on counterinsurgency tactics. In a secondary agenda, I study the intersection between domestic politics and foreign policy, emphasizing the role of domestic politics in foreign policy making.

I hold an MA and a BA in International Relations from Bilkent University.
